The engineer spent about 5 mins at thr property shone his torch down the side of the shower and blamed the leak on sealent, he offered the customer a temp repair that woulf have been chargeable but the customer declined. The first engineer then left the property promptly without locating a leak and assured the customer that it was to do with the sealent. Since the appt the customer noticed that the leak was still occuring and causing damage and she called for another dyno engineer booked for 10.11.16 (SO-6985967-8DHD). The engineer arrived at the property and pulled the shower out to look behind and found that there were 2 leaks behind the shower that had been ongoing for a long time and he said that if the first engineer would have looked properly then she wouldnt have had so much damage to the property. pics were taken of damage and given to LO and customer is expecting to be compensated for the damaged caused by the leak that was overlook. The LO (SSP LTD - 3439) said that it was consequencial damage that was a result of the fir st leak and she would not be compensated as she declined the temp fix unfortunately the 2nd engineer did not leave sufficient note to suggest that the leak was overlooked in the first instance.']"
